    <h1>This page catalogues my recent forays into Art and Design. I spent my teens painting with acrylic on canvas, and studied printmaking techniques in college, but more recently, I've been working on transferring those experiences and learned techniques to digital designs. </h1>
    <h4 style="padding-bottom: 36px; margin-top: 30px;">A Hypothetical Tomato Farm</h4>
    <div class="picture-holder">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="heirloom.png" alt="a poster for heirloom tomatoes" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="flyer.PNG" alt="a fake invite with bowls of tomatoes" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="bite.png" alt="cross sections of tomatoes with the words bite me" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div> 
    <h1 style="padding-top: 0; margin: 0;">I've been really enjoying drawing fruit recently, especially tomatoes. So much so that I built a whole fictional tomato farm in my head and created some fonts and a color pallete and a whole series of three promotional posters for said farm. I found that a lot of my approach to font and spacing and visual clutter followed the same strategies and patterns I'd use for designing a website - the translation between layers of artwork and divs is pretty seamless.</h1>   
    <h4 style="padding-bottom: 36px; margin-top: 30px;">Attempts at Making GIFs</h4>
    <div class="picture-holder">
        <ul>
          <li>
            <img src="papercut.GIF" alt="matisse style squigles in GIF form" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="bowls.GIF" alt="same bowls of tomatoes from above, but as a GIF" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
          <li>
            <img src="santa.GIF" alt="a GIF of santa juggling" style="width: 20rem;">
          </li>
        </ul>
      </div> 
    <h1 style="padding-top: 0; margin: 0;">As I started creating more digital sketches, I began to get curious about turning artwork into GIFs. I watched a lot of Procreate tutorials and their interface has a lot of support for animation, and once I familiarized myself with the tools available, I started creating little GIFs, often using them as an extension of sketches (you'll see that the bowls from the tomato farm poster became ones that fill with different tomatoes as the GIF continues). This artform is certainly still something I am exploring and working on, and I'll be sure to add the details and results of any major breakthroughs to this portfolio.</h1>
